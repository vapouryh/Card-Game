How to play:

In the game there are 2 players.
There are 30 cards in a deck.
Each card is unique and there are three suits that they could be in.
The suits are: red, black and yellow.
In each suit there are cards ranging from 1 to 10 in value.

Each time a player takes a card from the top of the deck, 
it is chosen at random from the shuffled deck of cards.
Player 1 picks first with Player 2 afterwards.

If both players have a card of the same colour, the player with the highest number wins.
If both players have different colours, the winning colour is as shown in the table below:

+--------+--------+--------+
| Card 1 | Card 2 | Winner |
+--------+--------+--------+
| Red    | Black  | Red    |
+--------+--------+--------+
| Yellow | Red    | Yellow |
+--------+--------+--------+
| Black  | Yellow | Black  |
+--------+--------+--------+

The winner of each round keeps both cards.
The game ends when there are no cards left in the deck.
